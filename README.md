Established MC Veteran since the original addition of The Nether.
Been around since Alpha.
Used to call myself "lolkuro," lost the account after loaning it to a cousin who turned out to be a little asshole.
Used to run a crew called BLAC [Bastardly Legion of Anarchists & Con-Artists], had it usurped from me by a little bastard called "Posidem" back in 2013.

OG Member of ANTagonist Gaming's "Anime Bunker" and Arts & Entertainment's "Red Dragon Inn" from the old AOL chatrooms. RIP AnimA & Rhy'Din.
Used to be called "HalcyonLives", "MachZero87", "MintBoy", "RegulusXavier", and "Kuro Inzen" way back when I used to RP.

ROM Hacker, Shooper and Sprite Artist, still fiddle with that stuff now and then.
